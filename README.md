Welcome to the [Calendar of Life](https://t.me/TimeGridBot) codebase. We're building our own life expand community. We've opensourced the code so that everyone can learn about how collections are created and the community is regulated. We also leave the opportunity for participants to modify the code and propose those changes that they consider necessary.

We only use articles from the [nature jornals](https://www.nature.com/siteindex) (preferring only nature and nature review journals) as a source of information for newsletters. We try to keep the database of articles and journals extremely limited and manually reviewed by our specialists. This is how we try to be as scientifically correct as possible.

‚öôÔ∏è TL;DR: Python, JavaScript, Postgres, telegram bots

We try to keep our code simple and stupid, because we are not very smart ourselves, and the only developer is a bioinformatician. We used Python almost everywhere, but JavaScript was used to generate the calendar but in the future we want to rewrite [encryption](https://github.com/subpolare/life-calendar/blob/main/security/encryption.py) in Go (for educational purposes). The database is built in PostgreSQL.

# Security Policy

We deeply value your privacy and security. Each chat has its own unique encryption key, securely encrypted with a master key. We store only minimal personal information: your Telegram ID, name, date of birth, and key life events — nothing else. All data is encrypted using AES-GCM with randomly generated nonces, ensuring your information remains secure at rest and in transit.

Your data is securely stored in a PostgreSQL database with encrypted access, protecting it from unauthorized retrieval. If you discover any vulnerabilities or security concerns, please responsibly report them by opening an issue in this repository or contacting us directly — we greatly appreciate your help in keeping our users safe.
